					<p>The concept behind the Dinner Show is to allow you to personally experience for yourself, in the comfort of your own home, surrounded by family and friends just how well the Red 5/Saladmaster system works.</p>
			
					<p>Along with an informative presentation about important Health and Nutrition issues, guests will receive a cooking demonstration, all guests will have a delicious and tasty five course meal prepared and cooked before their eyes in around 35 minutes.</p>
					
					<p>Saladmaster is a health and nutrition company from America that has been trading since 1946 and currently trades in over 40 different countries. The purpose of the dinner show is to show how to prepare and cook food using no fats, grease or oils of any kind, very little water and on very low temperatures which retains up to 93% of the valuable nutrients and minerals within the food.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<p>Most people ask ‘Well how do you cook vegetables without water? Which is a good question because nearly everyone has been conditioned to believe that is the only way to cook vegetables. The big question that needs to be asked is WHY it's important to cook without water? The best way to explain everything is to demonstrate exactly how it all works.</p>
			
					<p>The demonstration will be conducted as follows:</p>
					
					<ol type="1">
						<li>We will take you through some seemingly minor health and nutrition tips that however have a great impact on our health</li>
						<li>We will freshly prepare and cook you and your</li>
						<li>10 item Harvest salad drenched in lemon juice</li>
						<li>Golden brown fried chicken with our home made onion, ginger & apple source</li>
						<li>A 5 vegetable medley cooked in one container using zero water</li>
						<li>Cheesy scalloped potatoes but we de-starch the potatoes and defat the cheese.</li>
						<li>Bake you a delicious chocolate cake with a twist</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<p>All that healthy food and it's only 600 calories!! So you can eat as much as you want and still normalize your weight. (NB: You can cook any cuisine- this is just for the show).</p>
			
					<p>We then conduct two scientific tests to determine whether loss of nutrients and pollution are prevalent in your current food preparation methods.</p>
					
					<p>We show you the range of Saladmaster products that are available for investment as may be prioritized</p>
					
					<p>Please inform us of an appropriate date at the earliest for a full demonstration to last about 2.5 hours.</p>

	          	<h3>Why would you give away a free meal?</h3>
				<p>We do not spend any money on advertising, we feel it's better to use any marketing budget to reward our customers and consultants, and the best way to do that is to run free absolutely no obligation in home dinners to demonstrate the many benefits of our system. Advertising is very expensive and in some cases in can be prohibitively expensive. We realized many years ago that the most effective form of advertising is personal recommendations from happy clients. You do not need to purchase anything and there is no obligation to purchase anything. 
	All we ask is that if you are impressed with what you see that you will happily refer us onto your friends and relatives.</p>
